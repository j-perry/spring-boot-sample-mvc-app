# Spring Boot Sample MVC Application
A basic Spring Boot MVC application that provides developers the basis to create standalone web applications written in JavaScript.

This is not a RESTful Spring Boot based project, you can modify it to do so; howeverthere is however one available in my repository.

This is a project I will be using in an upcoming pet project.
