# Spring Boot Sample MVC Application
A basic Spring Boot 2 MVC application that provides developers the basis to create standalone web applications written in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, etc.

This is not a RESTful Spring Boot based project, you can modify it to do so; there is however one available in my repository.

This is a project I will be using in an upcoming pet project.

## Usage

`man spring-boot:run`
